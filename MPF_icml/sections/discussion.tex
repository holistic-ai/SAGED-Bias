\subsection{Advantages of MPE}
Our approach offers several key advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Training-Free}: No additional training required, making it cost-effective and easily deployable
    \item \textbf{Flexibility}: Can be applied to any pre-trained language model
    \item \textbf{Interpretability}: The ensemble mechanism provides transparency in decision-making
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: Efficient implementation allows for real-time application
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
Current limitations of MPE include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dependency on the quality of individual perspectives
    \item Potential trade-offs between bias reduction and performance
    \item Computational overhead in the ensemble process
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}
Potential directions for future research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Integration with other debiasing techniques
    \item Extension to more complex bias types
    \item Development of automated perspective generation
    \item Application to other modalities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Societal Impact}
The implications of our work include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item More fair and equitable AI systems
    \item Reduced propagation of harmful biases
    \item Better alignment with human values
    \item Improved trust in AI systems
\end{itemize}
