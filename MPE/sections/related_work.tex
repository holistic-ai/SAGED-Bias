\subsection{Language Model Biases}
Language models have been shown to exhibit various forms of bias, including gender bias \cite{bolukbasi2016man}, racial bias, and other societal biases \cite{caliskan2017semantics}. These biases can manifest in different ways, from word embeddings to generated text.

\subsection{Debiasing Approaches}
Existing debiasing approaches can be broadly categorized into:

\subsubsection{Training-Based Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fine-tuning on debiased datasets
    \item Adversarial training
    \item Counterfactual data augmentation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Post-Processing Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Word embedding debiasing
    \item Output filtering
    \item Prompt engineering
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ensemble Methods}
Ensemble methods have been used in various NLP tasks to improve performance and robustness. However, their application to bias mitigation has been limited. Our work extends ensemble approaches to specifically address bias in language models.

\subsection{Multi-Perspective Learning}
The concept of multiple perspectives has been explored in various domains, but its application to language model debiasing is novel. Our approach builds upon this concept while maintaining model coherence and performance.
