\subsection{Experimental Setup}
We evaluate MPE on multiple benchmarks and compare it with state-of-the-art debiasing methods. Our experiments focus on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Bias reduction effectiveness
    \item Model performance preservation
    \item Computational efficiency
    \item Generalization across different domains
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Datasets}
We use the following datasets for evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item SAGED (Sentiment Analysis and Generation Evaluation Dataset)
    \item XNTION (Cross-Nation) benchmark
    \item Additional domain-specific datasets for generalization testing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Baselines}
We compare MPE with several baselines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fine-tuning based debiasing methods
    \item Prompt engineering approaches
    \item Other ensemble-based methods
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
We use the following metrics to evaluate our approach:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Distribution-based metrics (Wasserstein, KL, TV)
    \item Task-specific performance metrics
    \item Bias measurement metrics
    \item Computational efficiency metrics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}
Our implementation uses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Python 3.8+
    \item PyTorch for model operations
    \item NumPy for numerical computations
    \item SciPy for optimization
\end{itemize}

The experiments were conducted on NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 80GB memory.
