Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks. However, they often exhibit biases in their outputs, reflecting and potentially amplifying societal biases present in their training data. While fine-tuning approaches have been proposed to address these issues, they often require significant computational resources and may not generalize well across different contexts.

We introduce MPE (Multi-Perspective Ensemble), a novel training-free approach for debiasing and aligning language models. Our method leverages multiple perspectives through a sophisticated ensemble mechanism that combines different viewpoints while maintaining model coherence. The key contributions of this work are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel training-free approach to debiasing that leverages multiple perspectives
    \item A sophisticated ensemble mechanism that combines different viewpoints while maintaining coherence
    \item Comprehensive evaluation across various benchmarks demonstrating significant improvements in reducing bias
    \item Analysis of the trade-offs between bias reduction and model performance
\end{itemize}

Our approach is particularly appealing because it:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Requires no additional training or fine-tuning
    \item Can be applied to any pre-trained language model
    \item Maintains model performance while reducing bias
    \item Provides interpretable results through the ensemble mechanism
\end{itemize}
