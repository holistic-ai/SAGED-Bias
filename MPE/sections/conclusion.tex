In this paper, we presented MPE, a novel training-free approach for debiasing and aligning language models through multi-perspective ensemble. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in reducing bias while maintaining model performance across various benchmarks.

Key contributions of our work include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel training-free debiasing approach
    \item A sophisticated ensemble mechanism
    \item Comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks
    \item Analysis of trade-offs and limitations
\end{itemize}

Our results show that MPE effectively reduces bias while preserving model performance, making it a practical solution for real-world applications. The training-free nature of our approach makes it particularly appealing for deployment in production environments.

Future work will focus on addressing current limitations and extending the approach to more complex bias types and other modalities. We believe that MPE represents a significant step forward in the development of fair and equitable AI systems.
